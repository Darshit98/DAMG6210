Scope:

Students will identify their preferred programs available at dream colleges with the aid of our project. Students will get a list of universities shortlisted based on their profile.

Description:

1.. Our database will include a list of universities and colleges that offer various courses, along with the criteria used for selection.
2. The database will recommend the appropriate university and the course the student can take based on the profile scan.
3. The students can filter the program's start (Spring/Fall/Summer), and the database will compare their profiles to suggest them.
4. Based on the university's Visa approval rate, students will be able to make a choice.
